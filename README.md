# Khayyam Offline Persian Handwriting Dataset
<p align="justify">
Handwriting analysis is still an important application in machine learning. A basic requirement for any
handwriting recognition application is the availability of comprehensive datasets. Standard labelled datasets
play a significant role in training and evaluating learning algorithms. In this paper, we present the Khayyam
dataset as another large unconstrained handwriting dataset for elements (words, sentences, letters, digits) of
the Persian language. We intentionally concentrated on collecting Persian word samples which are rare in the
currently available datasets. Khayyam's dataset contains 44000 words, 60000 letters, and 6000 digits.
Moreover, the forms were filled out by 400 native Persian writers. To show the applicability of the dataset,
machine learning algorithms are trained on the digits, letters, and word data and results are reported. This
dataset is available for research and academic use.

 The paper of the dataset is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01025).

من می‌گویم که آب انگور خوش است

این نقد بگیر و دست از آن نسیه بدار

که‌آواز دهل شنیدن از دور خوش است
